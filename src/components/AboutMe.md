I am a *software engineer, problem solver, mentor, minimalist, overthinker*.

I love to both build and break things. I am motivated by challenging projects with self-guided research and complex problem statements. My true passion is in *understanding technology* by building it myself.

This is my personal space, where I share my *work and projects*. I also write blog posts about engineering and design.
